function [iVert,iFace] = adjacentMeshElements(surf,iPts,maxDist)
%ADJACENTMESHELEMENTS finds vertices and faces which are adjacent to the selected vertices on the input surface mesh
% 
%  [iVert,iFace] = adjacentMeshElements(surf,iPts,maxDist)
%  [iVert,iFace] = adjacentMeshElements(surf,qPts,maxDist)
% 
%  This function finds, for each input vertex, all vertices and faces on
%  the input mesh surface which are within the specified distance of the
%  input vertex, and which are connected to the input vertices by edges
%  which are also within the specified radius of the input points.
%  Therefore, vertices which are within the specified cartesian distance of
%  the input vertices, but are topologically distant along the mesh
%  surface, will not be returned.
% 
%   Input:
% 
%       surf - The structure containing the surface mesh to find adjacent
%       points on, stored in the FV format (faces,vertices) used by patch,
%       isosurface etc.
% 
%       iPts - An integer scalar or vector specifying the indices of
%       vertices on the mesh to find adjacents points to.
%               ----OR-----
%       iPts - Mx3 matrix containing the [x,y,z] positions of the points to
%       find adjacent mesh vertices for. Topology will be determined based
%       on the closest point on the mesh to these points.
%
%       maxDist - A positive scalar or Mx1 vector specifying The maximum
%       distance from the input point to consider adjacent points. If
%       input as a scalar, the same distance is used for all input
%       points, if a vector the same length as iPts, then this specifies a
%       different max distance to use for each selected vertex.
%
%  
%   Output:
%
%       iVert - Mx1 cell array, the m-th element of which contains the
%       indices of the vertices which are within the maxDist of the m-th
%       input vertex.
%
%       iFace - Mx1 cell array, the m-th element of which contains the
%       indices of the faces for which all three vertices are within the
%       maxDist of the m-th input vertex.
