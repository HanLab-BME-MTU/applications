+TIP Detection, Tracking, and Post-Processing README

This README explains how to do the following:
- Set up new projects
- Select one or more projects to analyze together
- Run detection, tracking, and post-processing

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROJECT SETUP

A new project begins with a tiff series in a folder called "images."  As
analysis commences, folders called roi_1, roi_2, etc. will be created.  
Multiple projects will only be necessary for a given image series if
there are multiple cells in the field of view (analysis at the sub-cellular
scale is possible with post-processing functions).  Even in that case, it 
is generally ok to analyze them together unless you want to look at cell-cell
heterogeneity.

For a new project, click "Set Up New Project(s)." 
You will be prompted to select a top-level directory.  This can be any
directory as long as there are one or more directories called "images"
containing the tif series you want to analyze.  

If "Draw ROI" is checked, you will be able to draw up to 9 regions-of-interest
(ROIs) per movie.  The first frame of each movie will appear in succession
and allow you to draw a polygons.  Left-clicking to add points and close the
polygon by right-clicking on the first point and selecting "Create mask."  
If "Draw ROI" is unchecked, you will be prompted to click in the center
of the cell on the first frame.  The whole image will then be considered 
to be the ROI for future steps. (The click simply helps the comet detector 
estimate the local background.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROJECT SELECTION

This step allows you to choose one or more projects (i.e. roi_1 folders) 
for analysis.  This allows you to analyze many movies at once, provided they 
have the same parameters.

If "Load projList" is checked, you will be asked to select one or more 
projList.mat files containing the directory paths to various projects you
have previously analyzed.  This is a shortcut, as generating the project 
list can be time-consuming with large directory trees.
The projList.mat file is generated by the function getProj.m,
which is called during project setup from plusTipAnalysis.  (You can also
run getProj from the command line to generate more specific project lists.
See function header for details.)  If "Load projList" is unchecked, you
will select a parent directory containing previously-analyzed projects.

If "Narrow down list" is checked, a window will pop up asking for one or more
search strings.  These are strings of characters that can be used to narrow
down the number of projects you have to scroll through when selecting
from a long list. For example, if "ctrl" appears anywhere in the file path
to your control movies, you may enter "ctrl" into the search string list.
Only those projects matching all the query strings will pop up.  If 
"Narrow down list" is unchecked, this step is bypassed and all the projects 
will appear in the list.

From the resultant list of projects, choose one or more and use the arrow 
to move them from the left to the right.  

TROUBLESHOOTING:

* If you have not created a roi_x directory, it will not appear in the list. 

* If no projects are found, check to make sure there are no spaces anywhere 
in the directory path or file names.

* If you get the message "Select any directory above input directory", the 
root of your Matlab current directory does not match the root directory
where your project is stored.  Point to the relevant server location.

TRACKING PARAMETERS

Maximum gap length (frames): max number of frames that can separate two
growth trajectories for them to be considered candidates for gap closing. 
8-10 is generally a good range.

Minimum track length (frames): minimum number of consecutive frames over
which a feature must persist in order to be retained as a track. 3 is
the default.

Search radius range (pixels): min/max distance away from a feature's projected
position (based on its movement in the past) to consider when looking for
candidate features in the next frame.  This will depend on the average speed,
the frame rate, and how much heterogeneity there is between frame-to-frame  
displacements. You will probably want to try several ranges to find the 
optimal values for your data, though the tracker is not super sensitive to 
these values.  (e.g. for 2sec data, try 15-20; for 0.8sec data, try 3-5)

Maximum angle (degrees): only tracks which begin within the cones bounded
by +/- the forward or backward angle from the end track's final direction
will be considered as candidates for gap closing.

Max shrinkage factor: how fast shrinkage is expected to occur relative to
growth.  (e.g. if a MT grows at 10 microns/min, and we assume it cannot 
shrink faster than 15 microns/min, then this parameter is 1.5.)

Fluctuation radius (pixels): the size of a small disk around a track's final
point, within which candidate tracks are considered to be pause rather
than actively polymerizing or depolymerizing.  This prevents small fluctuations
in the backward direction from being classified as shrinkage events.  In
addition, this parameter defines the smallest width of the forward and 
backward cones.
