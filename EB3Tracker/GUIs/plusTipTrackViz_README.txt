+TIP Track Visualization README

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview of supported track visualization modes:

5a. Overlay tracks on a frame of the movie, with the option to select 
    individual tracks for more information about them
5b. Make a scatter plot of two parameters (i.e. growth speed and growth 
    lifetime) divided into quadrants depending on percentiles. The colors 
    of the four quadrants correspond to tracks overlain on an image in a 
    second figure
5c. Make a movie of EITHER all tracks within a region and within a frame range 
                    OR     one or more individual tracks
5d. Make a movie where features are color-coded by speed (microns/min)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Track Type Quick Reference for 5a and 5c - see details below
1 - growth                               (red)
2 - forward gap  (pause or out of focus) (cyan)
3 - backward gap (shrinkage)             (yellow)
4 - unclassified gap                     (magenta)

STEPS:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Select Project (OPTIONAL) 

Note: once you choose a project, it can be used for multiple tasks 
(e.g. 5a followed by 5b).  You can choose a new one at any time, or click 
"Reset" to start over. If you do not choose the project first, you can 
still run 5a and 5b, but you will have to select the project for each one 
separately.

If "Load projList" is checked, you will be asked to select one or more 
projList.mat files containing the directory paths to various projects you
have previously analyzed.  This is a shortcut, as generating the project 
list can be time-consuming with large directory trees.
The projList.mat file is generated by the function getProj.m,
which is called during project setup from plusTipAnalysis.  (You can also
run getProj from the command line to generate more specific project lists.
See function header for details.)  If "Load projList" is unchecked, you
will select a parent directory containing previously-analyzed projects.

If "Narrow down list" is checked, a window will pop up asking for one or more
search strings.  These are strings of characters that can be used to narrow
down the number of projects you have to scroll through when selecting
from a long list. For example, if "ctrl" appears anywhere in the file path
to your control movies, you may enter "ctrl" into the search string list.
Only those projects matching all the query strings will pop up.  If 
"Narrow down list" is unchecked, this step is bypassed and all the projects 
will appear in the list.

From the resultant list of projects, choose one and use the arrow to move 
it from the left to the right.  

TROUBLESHOOTING:

* If you have created a roi_x directory but have not run tracking and 
post-processing, it will not appear in the list. 

* Unlike plusTipAnalysis, plusTipTrackViz one can only work with one project 
at a time.

* If no projects are found, check to make sure there are no spaces anywhere 
in the directory path or file names.

* If you get the message "Select any directory above input directory", the 
root of your Matlab current directory does not match the root directory
where your project is stored.  Point to the relevant server location.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Select Saved ROI (OPTIONAL) 

Click the button if you want to use a saved roiYX.mat or roiMask.tif file.
These are saved during the initial ROI selection from plusTipAnalysis and 
also for each movie that is generated.  Once you load one ROI, it can be 
used for multiple tasks (e.g. 5a followed by 5b).  You can choose a new one
at any time, or click "Reset" to start over with no ROI.  If no ROI is 
chosen, 5a will use the whole image, while 5c and 5d will ask you to 
select a new ROI. 5b currently does not make use of the ROI whether it is
selected or not.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Choose Frame Range (OPTIONAL)

Default is all frames. The frame range chosen here will be applied to 5a, 
5c, and 5d.  5b uses data from all the frames regardless of the frame range
chosen here.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Select Output Directory (OPTIONAL)

Select the directory in which to store movies.  Note that overlays and 
scatterplots, unlike movies, are not automatically saved.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
5a. Overlay tracks on image with "Track Overlays"

All tracks within the frame range will appear as an overlay on an image
chosen by the user (e.g. first frame of frame range).
 
If "Select Tracks" is checked, the user will be prompted to click one or 
more times on the image. Information about the tracks will appear in the 
Matlab command window as follows:

Track: trackNumber   Frame: frame closest to where user selected
    [trackNumber startFrame endFrame velocity trackType]

where velocity is in microns/min and trackType is:
1 - growth                               (red)
2 - forward gap  (pause or out of focus) (cyan)
3 - backward gap (shrinkage)             (yellow)
4 - unclassified gap                     (magenta)

The track numbers selected will then show up in a new text window below the 
"Plot tracks" button. These are useful if, for example, you want to quickly
make a movie of the track you selected.

The "Plot Tracks" button calls plusTipPlotTracks.m.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

5b. Map microtubule dynamics onto the cell with "Quadrant Scatter"

Use the Quadrant Scatter option to color-code tracks falling within 
specified ranges of various parameters.  Select parameters to be plotted on
a 2D scatter plot, such as growth speed and growth lifetime.  Adjust the 
percentile values for each independently and select "Make Plot."

If "Remove tracks at start/end" is checked, all tracks existing in the
first or last tracked frame will not be included.  Lifetime measurements
can be biased especially in short movies where most tracks will exist at
the beginning or end.

Six figures will appear: a scatter plot and five images with tracks overlaid.  
The colors of the tracks correspond to the color map of the scatter plot.  
For example, if we take the 50th percentile for growth speed and growth 
lifetime we will see four populations in four colors: fast and short-lived,
slow and short-lived, fast and long-lived, and slow and long-lived.  The 
four populations will appear separately in four images and together in a
fifth image.

It is also possible to divide the population of tracks based on one 
parameter into three groups.  For example, if we choose growth speed for
both the x- and y- axes, and select the 25th and 50th percentiles, 
respectively, we will see three populations in three colors: tracks in Q1, 
tracks in Q4, and tracks in both Q2 and Q3.  In this case one figure will 
represent the raw image.

Because the values on the x- and y- axes must be paired, only certain 
combinations of parameters work.  The track type (e.g. "shrinkage") must be
the same for x- and y- axes.

Note that the frame range specified in 3 is ignored; tracks from the range
used in the post-processing step are used.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

5c. Make a movie using feature detection results and/or track overlays with
"Track Movies"

The "Display Detected Features" radio buttons and the "Display Tracks"
check box control how the detected features and tracks and are displayed 
on the movie.

    * Track features only, all frames: displays only the features used in the
    tracks, color-coded by frame, such that features in a track appear shortly 
    before and after a track.

    * All features, all frames: displays ALL the detected features (ie including
    those that did not get incorporated into a track), color-coded by frame.  
    These are displayed throughout the frame range.  This option is useful
    for checking whether a tracking mistake might be due to a missed detection
    or to wrong linking, for example.

    * All features, current frame only: displays all the detected features from
    a given frame in that frame only.

    * Don't show any features: use this option if you want to make a movie of 
    the raw data or if you only want to show the track without the features.

The "Individual Track Numbers" text box can be used to make movies of
individual tracks.  The track numbers correspond to those found in the first
column of projData.nTrack_sF_eF_vMicPerMin_trackType_lifetime_totalDispPix,
the matrix containing the tracking results after post-processing (see the 
plusTipAnalysis README file for more details). 

You may find it useful to select tracks in 5a and copy and paste the track 
numbers into this text box. Or, load projData manually and look for 
interesting tracks to plot.

Please note that frame range input is ignored when plotting individual
tracks. A movie will be made of the entire track.

If the "Individual Track Numbers" text box is empty, all tracks will
be shown for the ROI.

The "Dual panel with raw images" function creates a movie where the raw
image is shown on the left and the detection and/or track overlay is shown
on the right.  
 
The "Save as AVI" check box determines whether the movie will be saved as 
.MOV (default) or .AVI.  The AVI option crashes in some versions of Linux, 
so it is advised to leave this box unchecked when working in Linux.
 
The "Make Track Movie" button calls plusTipTrackMovie.m.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

5d. Make a movie where features are color-coded by speed using "Speed Movies"

"Speed Limit" is the maximum speed used in the jet color map (e.g. an input 
of 20 will map all speeds lower than -20 microns/min to -20 and all speeds 
higher than 20 to 20, ranging from dark blue to deep red. Negative speeds 
correspond to shrinkage velocities, because shrinking microtubules move
away from the direction of growth. The default option (max) uses the whole 
range.  

The "Save as AVI" check box determines whether the movie will be saved as 
.MOV (default) or .AVI.  The AVI option crashes in some versions of Linux, 
so it is advised to leave this box unchecked when working in Linux.

The "Make Speed Movie" button calls plusTipSpeedMovie.m.
