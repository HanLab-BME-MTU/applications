>> InvivoCytometer_Manual_v2.0.pdf

A manual that describes in detail how to use the software

>> code_package

Contains the source code of the software. Users with access to matlab, can set this directory as the working directory and run the software by 
typing InvivoCytometer at the matlab commandline. This way was tested to
work on windows, linux, and mac and is also much faster than the standalone
windows application. So if the user has matlab, we recommend this way to 
use the software tool.

>> sample data

Some sample image data and a sample analysis result. Read the software manual for more details on how to load the data/analysis files into the
software.
