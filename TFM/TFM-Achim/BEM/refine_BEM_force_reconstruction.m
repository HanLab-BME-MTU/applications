% In case of L>0 and if the basis function have differently sized support
% then, the basis functions have the be appropriately weighted in the
% regularization term according to their unit volume. E.g. denser sampling
% in region of constant stress must not change the result. Thus L*|F|^2
% should be the same!
% Get the unit volume for each basisfunction:
weights  =vertcat(refinedForceMesh.basis(:).unitVolume);
% We have the same weights for the x and y components of the basis functions:
repWeights=repmat(weights(:),2,1);
% Normalize the weights with the largest base-function:
normWeights=repWeights/max(repWeights);
% Create the diagonal matrix with the weights, if the support is the same
% for all basis functions, then this will end up to be the identity matrix
% as has been used before [eye(2*refinedForceMesh.numBasis)]:
eyeWeights=diag(normWeights);
