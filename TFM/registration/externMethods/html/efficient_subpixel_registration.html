%% Syntax
% The code receives the FFT of the reference and the shifted images, and an
% (integer) upsampling factor. The code expects FFTs with DC in (1,1) so do not use
% fftshift.
%
%    output = dftregistration(fft2(f),fft2(g),usfac);
%
% The images are registered to within 1/usfac of a pixel.
%
% output(1) is the normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) [1] between f and
% g. 
%
% output(2) is the global phase difference between the two images (should be
% zero if images are real-valued and non-negative).
%
% output(3) and output(4) are the row and column shifts between f and g respectively. 
%
%    [output Greg] = dftregistration(fft2(f),fft2(g),usfac);
%
% Greg is an optional output, it returns the Fourier transform of the registered version of g,
% where the global phase difference [output(2)] is also compensated.


%% Obtain a reference and shifted images
% To illustrate the use of the algorithm, lets obtain a reference and a
% shifted image. First we read the reference image f(x,y)
f = im2double(imread('cameraman.tif'));

% Define g(x,y) as a version of f(x,y) shifted by fractional values of a
% pixel and multiplied by a global phase.

% We have shifted the image by 8.73837 and -3.48574 pixels in the x and
% y direction, respectively, and added a phase of 2 radians to g(x,y). The shift 
% was implemented by applying a linear phase on its
% FT, thus we have assumed that the images wrap around (features leaving one

% (interpolated by a sinc function). Cross-correlation image registration by DFTs 
% (both the matrix-multiply DFT and the zero-padded FFT) share these assumptions. 
%
% This registration technique is well suited to compare images that are captured
% in Fourier domain (i.e. to evaluate an image reconstruction by holography
% or phase retrieval) which are strictly band-limited and exhibit the

% the image brings in new content instead of wrapping it around or when the
% images are not band-limited.

%% Sample Image Registration
% dftregistration.m receives the FT of f and g and the upsampling factor. 
% The code expects DC of the FTs at (1,1) so don't use fftshift. 
%
% We now use the image registration code to register f and g within 0.01
% pixels by specifying an upsampling parameter of 100
usfac = 100;
[output, Greg] = dftregistration(fft2(f),fft2(g),usfac);

% is 0.0016 and 0.0043 in the x and y directions respectively. Well within
