function M=fsmTrackTrackerBMTNN(I,J,radius,influence)
% fsmTrackTrackerBMTNN tracks particle postions resolving topological conflicts with neural networks
%
% SYNOPSIS   M=fsmTrackTrackerBMTNN(Lmax1,Lmax2,radius,influence)
%
% INPUT      I         :  matrix [y x I]n of speckle coordinates and intensities for frame 1
%            J         :  matrix [y x I]n of speckle coordinates and intensities for frame 2
%            radius    :  search radius
%            influence :  radius of influence for the neural network tracker. This is the initial search
%                         radius; the neural network can more effectively reconstruct flow if it can
%                         search over larger areas and therefore take more particles into account. The final
%                         matches will be constrained to have a maximum distance = 'radius', but initially 
%                         a larger search radius ('influence') will be used.
%
% OUTPUT     M         :  matrix of matches [y1(1) x1(1) y1(2) x1(2)]n
