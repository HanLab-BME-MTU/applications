function samples = sampleImageWindows(windows,im,mask)
%SAMPLEIMAGEWINDOWS samples the image intensity in each of the input windows
%
% samples = sampleImageWindows(windows,image,mask);
%
% This function calculates and returns various statistics regarding the
% pixel values in the input image within each of the input window polygons.
% The input windows should be of the form created by getMaskWindows.m or
% getMovieWindows.m
% 
% Input:
% 
%   windows - Cell-array containing window polygons, as produced by
%   getMaskWindows.m or getMovieWindows.m
% 
%   image - 2D matrix. The image to sample. Must be the same size as the
%   mask which was used to create the window array.
% 
%   mask - A 2D logical matrix of the same size as that used to create the
%   windows. Pixel values outside of this mask will treated as NaNs and
%   ignored in calculating image statistics. If you don't want to mask
%   additionally, just use the mask you used to create the windows.
% 
% Output:
% 
%   samples - Structure with fields containing the statistics of the image
%   pixels within each window. To ease analysis, instead of a cell array
%   like the windows, each field is a 2D MxN matrix, where N is the number
%   of window columns ("slices") and M is the maximum number of window rows
%   ("bands") in any column. Therefore, any elements of this matrix which
%   do not have a corresponding window will have NaN in their statistics.
%   Also, any windows which do not cover any masked pixels in the image
%   will have NaN in their statistics.
%
%     Details:
%
%       samples.avg - MxN matrix of average of pixel values in each window.
%       samples.med - MxN matrix of median of pixel values in each window.
%       samples.std - MxN matrix of standard deviation of pixel values in each window.
%       samples.min - MxN matrix of minimum of pixel values in each window.
%       samples.max - MxN matrix of maximum of pixel values in each window.
%       samples.n   - MxN matrix of number of pixels in each window.

% NOTE: We need to use the masks again here during sampling for several
% reasons. One, neither inpolygon.m nor poly2mask.m produce results which
% agree completely with the output of contourc.m or bwboundaries.m. That
% is, creating a polygon that surrounds a mask using either contourc.m or
% bwboundaries.m and then using poly2mask or inpolygon will NOT re-create
% the same mask. Second, the protrusion calculation functions use a
% smoothed version of the cell edge, which does not faithfully reproduce
% the outline of the mask. Therefore, any protrusion-based window
% propagation methods will no longer give windows which perfectly cover the
% mask. Third, if other window propagation methods are used, the windows
% may not completely agree with the masks in frames after the
% initialization/re-initialization frames. Therefore, as stupid as it
% sounds, we need to re-mask the images before we sample the window
% intensities, to avoid sampling un-masked values.
