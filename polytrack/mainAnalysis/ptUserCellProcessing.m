function [newCoord] = ptUserCellProcessing (inputImage, coord)
% ptUserCellProcessing displays an image with coordinates overlayed as red dots. It allows the user to manually edit missed or faulty coordinates.
%
% SYNOPSIS       [newCoord] = ptUserCellProcessing (inputImage, coord)
%
% INPUT          inputImage  : image to process
%                coord       : list of coordinates
%
% OUTPUT         newCoord : edited list of coordinates
%
% DEPENDENCIES   ptUserCellProcessing uses { nothing }
%                                  
%                ptUserCellProcessing is used by { ptInitializeJob }

% Show the image in a figure

% The user can click on cells. Everytime he or she presses ENTER, the changes will become visible.
% The user can continue to mark cells as long as he or she marks at least one cell between 
% pressing ENTER twice. Then the user will be asked if this is really correct. Left-click indicates yes, 
% and the function returns the new coordinates. Rightclick will let the user continue clicking around.
