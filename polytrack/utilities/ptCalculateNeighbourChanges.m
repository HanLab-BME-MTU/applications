% SYNOPSIS       ptCalculateNeighbourChanges (ptPostpro, MPM)
%
% INPUT          handles : a structure which contains the information from the GUI

% OUTPUT         neighChangeStats : struct with following fields:
%                     : vector with avg trajectory length changes
%
% DEPENDENCIES   ptCalculateNeighbourChanges  uses {nothing}
%                                  
%                ptCalculateNeighbourhoodChanges is used by { PolyTrack_PP }

% Andre Kerstens        Jul 04          Initial version of neighbour change calculation
% Andre Kerstens        Aug 04          Changed way how changes are counted; more accurate with new method
% Andre Kerstens        Aug 04          Changed neighbour datastore from cell array to struct (cell2mat 
%                                       function is way to slow!)
% Andre Kerstens        Aug 04          Fixed bug where csv where saved in wrong dir
% Andre Kerstens        Sep 04          Complete rewrite of plotting functions
