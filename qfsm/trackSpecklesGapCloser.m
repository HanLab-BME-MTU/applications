% fsmTrackgapCloser closes gaps in speckles lifetimes by recovering weak

%
% SYNOPSIS      [M,gapClosed]=fsmTrackGapCloser(M,threshold,strg,userPath,firstIndex,frame)
%
% INPUT         M          : M stack as returned by the tracker functions
%                                  M = [y x y x]   [y x y x]   [y x y x]

%               threshold  : radius of the considered neighborhood
%               invalidCands       : String to correctly format the numeric suffix of saved files
%               userPath   : Work path
%               firstIndex : index of the first corresponding image
%               frame      : optional - by default, the gap closer goes
%                            through the whole M stack and closes all gaps.
%                            Alternatively, it can be used to close exclusively 
%                            the gaps at tn somewhere in the middle of the M matrix.
%                            The user passes, for tn, M(:,:,n:n+1) to the gap
%                            closer and must also set the variable frame=n.
%                            This will be used to load the corresponding
%                            cands###.mat file (see fsm PREPROCESSING module).
%                            If size(M,3) is > 2 the input parameter frame is IGNORED. 
%
% OUTPUT        M          : corrected M stack
%               gapClosed  : number of gaps closed
